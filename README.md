C is a procedural prograamming language

C was invented in 1972 by the late Dennis Ritchie

C is widely regarded as the Godfather (Don CorleoneðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Ž) of modern programming languages

C is platform dependent, meaning that a programm written on a platform, let's say Linux won't run on another platform (windows)

C is also a high-level programming language making it more human friendly, but unlike other high-level languages, C lets us program close to the metal
